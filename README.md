Player Workload and OPTA Data Exploration

The presentation contains the work I have done during my internship at the UEFA's Intelligence Center. I contributed mainly to the Player Workload and OPTA Data Exploration projects. Due to confidentiality reasons, data is not available. However, the outcomes of the analysis and their interpretations are available in the 'player_workload.pdf' file, which serves as the summary of my analysis.
